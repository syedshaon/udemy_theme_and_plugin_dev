= Why a Quick AdSense fork? =

Quick Adsense is a great plugin and used by more than 100.000 websites. 
Although is not under maintainance and development for more than 3 years by the original author it is still downloaded hundred times a day.
So i decided to continue the project to make sure the plugin will also work in future with new WordPress versions.

Deprecated functions removed, bugs fixed and new filters and hooks created to make this plugin extensible by third party developers!
